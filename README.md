This is the most disorganized and irrelevant Github profile you could have ever find. Perhaps, one day I will start using it properly and post here real coding projects.

I have a little background of C# programming, but most of my time I am working on web-projects, currently slowly working on my own set of writing/content management tools for my website. Most of my commits are currently related to map making / level design and other art stuff though, since this is my main focus at the moment. I must eat to stay alive, y'know. I wish I had more time to shift my priorities to programming though...
